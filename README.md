## Run it yourself?

Clone the GitHub repo and run the following command. Be sure to be under the project's root folder to get your .venv and 
libraries all set up.

```bash
source initialize.sh
```

Note: It works for macOS and Linux only...

We are using Ollama for Llm hosting and ChromaDB for the vector/embedding DB, as they are both beginner-friendly and
allow for <b>local</b> deployment.

So... you need to download Ollama. To get the Ollama latest versions, go to their website:

Ollama:
https://ollama.com/download

Also, if you don't have Python downloaded, it is necessary as well... so go ahead and grab it.
